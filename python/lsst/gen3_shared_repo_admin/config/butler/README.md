# Butler configuration files

The files in this directory are YAML
[`daf_butler`](https://github.com/lsst/daf_butler) configuration files,
corresponding to different repositories, organized by name and/or creation date.
Files that exist are automatically picked up by repo definitions (see the
`RepoDefinition` class for how this works); those that don't exist are simply
ignored.
